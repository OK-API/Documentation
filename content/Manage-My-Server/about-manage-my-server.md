## What is Manage-My-Server?
Manage-My-Server is a project for collecting scripts that help you to manage your server. It is not meant to reinvent the wheel, if there are already suitable solutions out there. But as always there are a lot of scenarios out there, that are not yet covered by existing well spread solutions. Filling these gaps is part of the mission of this project.

## What kind of content to expect?
Anything around improving the management of a server. This can be an enhanced for backup sync control, focusing on your NAS, over lightweight monitoring solutions and dashboarding, or finally some functionality to allow you to perform asynchronous management tasks through your preferred messenger. There are a lot of ideas of specific use cases just waiting to be implemented. We do not aim to reinvent working solutions, or compete with some enterprise configuration management and monitoring tools, but we see the need for lean and easy to use automation for specific use cases. We do not develop specifically for private or enterprise use, but leave it up to the users how to implement solutions based on our automations.
If you are having an own idea or solution, feel free to [contribute](!../OK-API/about-okapi.md#how-can-i-contribute?).

## Paradigms
The Manage-My-Server project aims to provide functionality that is as easy to use as possible. That means we do not want to write code in languages that are not widely spread and require any setup in advance. No one should have to install exotic packages or manage any library dependencies, as we want to have as few dependencies as possible. 
The programs in this repository shall support the OK-API [philosophy](!../../../OK-API/about-okapi.md#ok-api-philosophy) and be:
- useful
- cover a defined use case
- stable even in changing environments
- easy to use and maintain
