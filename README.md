'OK-API' is the "O.K. - Automated Procedures Initiative".
In this organisation we bundle different projects for different topics, which all have 'automation' of regular tasks at their core. Even though they might have nothint to do with each other at the first glance, they can be combined to achieve automation in bigger scenarios.

Welcome to the central repository for documentation of all OK-API repositories. 
This is the place to contain comprehensive documentation, use cases, FAQs, background information, how-to guides and more for each OK-API project and the scripts.
